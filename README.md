# Personal Coding Coach API â€“ Day 1

**A backend-only, adaptive coding coach API built with Laravel 10.**  
This project represents **Day 1** of the Personal Coding Coach concept: a tool designed to track a userâ€™s coding journey, manage exercises, and provide a foundation for an adaptive learning experience.

> This API is ideal for learners, educators, and developers who want a clean, backend-first system to manage coding exercises and user progress.
